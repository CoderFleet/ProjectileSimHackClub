# Projectile Motion Simulation

This project is a web-based simulation of projectile motion using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visualize the trajectory of a projectile based on user-defined parameters such as initial velocity, launch angle, gravity, and air resistance.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust parameters like angle, initial velocity, gravity, air resistance, and simulation speed using sliders and buttons.
- **Real-time Simulation:** See the projectile motion trajectory update in real-time as parameters are adjusted.
- **Physics Formulas:** Display of essential physics formulas related to projectile motion.
- **Responsive Design:** Layout adjusts for various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience across devices.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/projectile-motion-simulation.git
